License Applier -- A simple Python Class including methods to recursively apply a license to some files.

Class is still young and buggy, but manages already C, C++, Javascript, PHP, Perl and Python files.
As it's still under heavy developement, some essential features are not included; the most critical being
the avoiding of files having a license header already. 

You can use that way:
    ./license-applier.py <file/dir1,...,file/dir> license_file

Using this command line util, selected files and dirs will be walked recursively, and the header contained in the license_file will be added at the top of each files meet.
