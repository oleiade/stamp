* Create an option to choose whether if we want to store the patched file
informations in a .stamp file in each folder walked through or in a unique file (which destination path would be given as an option too)

* Have to verify that the control structures such as if are evaluated 
from left to right. In order to be sure that the test on Stamper.py
line 106 is valid and efficient.

* Would be great to be able to buffer the already computed keys
from the fs database in order not to convert it's redis-like syntax
to a dict compatible tree each time a key is queried.

* manage containers call in read without semicolons, example : db.read('paths') should work. For the moment user have to pass db.read('paths:') in order for it to work.
